# QDog Project Front End Repository

QDog is a virtual vet app that lets pet owners reach licensed veterinarians in minutes.
It keeps prescriptions, notes, and past visits in one place and allows you to track your petâ€™s health over time.

This is a student project for COMP 4350 (Software Engineering 2) at the University of Manitoba.
This is an educational prototype, not a substitute for in-person veterinary care. Please do not submit real medical information.
The project documentation live on our Confluence space (see Quick Links below)

## Development Environment Setup Instructions

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) on instructions on how to set up your development tools and environment.

## PNPM Commands

### Install the dependencies

**Note:** Your IDE might warn you to use the same version of pnpm that we use (see the `packageManager` value in `package.json`). You can safely ignore that warning if your version is higher than what we use. If you use a majorly lower one, you might notice some subtle bugs. For example, being 1 major version (version 9) behind ours (version 10.7) can be bad, but being a few minor versions (version 10.4) behind ours is fine. This is because old PNPM might not successfully read new PNPM lockfiles.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Build the web app

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Run the web app locally

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Run the tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

### Setup Husky

```bash
pnpm prepare
```

### Run the linter

**Note:** If you want to use linter on a specific folder, replace `.` with the folder name you want to lint.

```bash
pnpm oxlint .
```
