# QDog Project Front End Repository

QDog is a virtual vet app that lets pet owners reach licensed veterinarians in minutes. 
It keeps prescriptions, notes, and past visits in one place and allows you to track your petâ€™s health over time.

This is a student project for COMP 4350 (Software Engineering 2) at the University of Manitoba.
This is an educational prototype, not a substitute for in-person veterinary care. Please do not submit real medical information. 
The project documentation live on our Confluence space (see Quick Links below)


## Repo Links

Due to the projects' requirement to have a second front end implemented during our final iteration, we decided that it would be best to split this project into two repositories: the front end and the back end. When it is needed we will create a third repository that contains the second implementation of our front end.
