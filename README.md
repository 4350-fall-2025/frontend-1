# QDog Project Front End Repository

QDog is a virtual vet app that lets pet owners reach licensed veterinarians in minutes.
It keeps prescriptions, notes, and past visits in one place and allows you to track your petâ€™s health over time.

This is a student project for COMP 4350 (Software Engineering 2) at the University of Manitoba.
This is an educational prototype, not a substitute for in-person veterinary care. Please do not submit real medical information.
The project documentation live on our Confluence space (see Quick Links below)

## Development Environment Setup Instructions

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) on instructions on how to set up your development tools and environment.

## Instructions on how to run locally:

### 1: Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/4350-fall-2025/frontend-1

### 2: Install pnpm

pnpm requires Node.js, so if that is not installed maybe go ahead and install that first.

Using homebrew (if you use mac):

```bash
brew install pnpm
```

Using npm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm@latest-10
```

### 3: Install dev dependecies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 4: Setup and Run Back End Server

As our server is not currently hosted on the cloud in order to run the app locally you need to set up the [back end](https://github.com/4350-fall-2025/backend).

The instructions are located [here](https://github.com/4350-fall-2025/backend/blob/develop/README.md).

Once done please run the back end server.

### 5: Run the Front End Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## PNPM Commands

### Install the dependencies

**Note:** Your IDE might warn you to use the same version of pnpm that we use (see the `packageManager` value in `package.json`). You can safely ignore that warning if your version is higher than what we use. If you use a majorly lower one, you might notice some subtle bugs. For example, being 1 major version (version 9) behind ours (version 10.7) can be bad, but being a few minor versions (version 10.4) behind ours is fine. This is because old PNPM might not successfully read new PNPM lockfiles.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Build the web app

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Run the web app locally

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Run the tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

### Setup Husky

```bash
pnpm prepare
```

### Run the linter

**Note:** If you want to use linter on a specific folder, replace `.` with the folder name you want to lint.

```bash
pnpm oxlint .
```
